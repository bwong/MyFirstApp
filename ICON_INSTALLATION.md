# Lucide Icons Installation Guide

## Required Packages

To use the new Lucide icons in your menu bar, you need to install these packages:

```bash
npm install lucide-react-native react-native-svg
```

## iOS Setup (if needed)

If you're running on iOS, you might need to run:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## What's Changed

The MenuBar component now uses professional Lucide icons instead of emojis:

- **Home**: Calendar-days icon (represents calendar/home)
- **Add Data**: Circle-plus icon (clean, minimal design)
- **Settings**: Modern gear icon

## Benefits

- ✅ Consistent icon style
- ✅ Scalable SVG icons
- ✅ No more "kiddie" emoji look
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Icon-only design (cleaner, more space-efficient)
- ✅ Full accessibility support with descriptive labels

The icons are now properly integrated and will display beautifully in your menu bar!
